Meeting Feb 19th 2016
------
Two big Topics
* How to display markers correctly on a small screen
* How to display overlays nicely on big screens, especially if there is not much content or the overlay is narrow (like the social streams)

Ideas for markers as they are
* Don't open all of the markers at the same time even on large screens. The idea is to show semi-collapsed marker which would then unfold if the mouse actually goes in to the marker area (To be tested)
* Think about icons on markers, it's unclear though how much valuable information these transport. Might be a nice idea though combined with the first point

Alternative Marker layouts on small screens
* Two different Layouts for Landscape and Portrait mode?
* On Portrait have Video show at top and content slide in from the bottom? Might make the view very crowded...
* Make the timeline horizontal?
* Have the markers run next to each other in the then horizontal timeline area (as described by Anthony)

Ideas for overlays on all screen:
* Slide in from the side or from the bottom, depending on the exact format of the screen. E.g. Portrait slide in from bottom, landscape slide in from right.
